    <p>Please make a note of below point</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Google Chrome Browser version 53.0 or above, as this tool has been tested for this plateform only.
        Some functionaliy might break or/and appearence might change on other browser</li>
      <li>If you suspect, some processing issue on backend server, then use WEBCONSOLE feature to analyse the same,
      which might help you fix the issue from your end if any</li>
      <li>If you suspect, some processing issue at browser side, then use GOOGLE browser console to see the log,
        which might help you fixing the issue from your end if any.</li>
      <li>If you suspect some issue after importing any data, then try clearing browser cache then enter main http url
      then enter those data manually. Such issue might be due to unexpected imported data</li>
      <li>If are you not using WEBCONSOLE then, make enable_log false in CONFIGURATION TAB, to save little backend load</li>
