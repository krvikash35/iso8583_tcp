      <p>Please make a note of below point</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Google Chrome Browser version 53.0 or above, as this tool has been tested for this plateform only.
          Some functionaliy might break or/and appearence might change on other browser</li>
        <li>If you suspect, some processing issue on backend server, then use WEBCONSOLE feature to analyse the same,
        which might help you fix the issue from your end if any</li>
        <li>If you suspect, some processing issue at browser side, then use GOOGLE browser console to see the log,
          which might help you fixing the issue from your end if any.</li>
        <li>If you suspect some issue after importing any data, then try clearing browser cache then enter main http url
        then enter those data manually. Such issue might be due to unexpected imported data</li>
        <li>If are you not using WEBCONSOLE then, make enable_log false in CONFIGURATION TAB, to save little backend load</li>

  <section id="about">
    <div class="title">ABOUT</div>
    <div class="body">
    <p>This is implementation of iso8583 standard. we can use this tool to generate iso8583 message,
      send and receive to/from any server that understand iso8583. End user of this tool will use
      standard web interface provide by browser. This tool has been designed and developed from end user
      percpective. we will see technical and function aspect in subsequent chapter.Below are some striking
      point of this tool.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full of feature</li>
        <li>simple and clean UI</li>
        <li>Highly configurable</li>
        <li>Multiuser</li>
        <li>Easy plugin of future feature request</li>
        <li>No deployable to enduser, just http url</li>
        <li>deploy backend at centralized server</li>
        <li>ISO8583 1987 and 1993 both version supported</li>

    <div class="body">
    <p>Understanding architecture does not only help in getting knwoledge, but also help in resolving or
      anlaysing the issue(if any) within reasonable time. In this tool, two diffrent architecture has
      used to accomplish diffrent feature.webconsole realted feature has been implemented with
      diffrent architectrue than other feature. webconsole uses websocket for full-duplex persistent
      connection, while other uses normal http connection. we will see both the diagram below.</p>

  <section id="data">
    <div class="title">DATA TAB</div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>We can use this tab to send iso8583 request and recive iso8583 response. In order to frame request,
      we have to enter field number and field value. Once data entry of request is done, then click button 'SEND REQUEST
      TO SERVER' for reciveing response. Some basic validation on entry of field data will be done, and corresponding
      validation message will be shown at top of data page, few of them are listed below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We can edit the exisitng field value by clicking or double-clicking on Field Value Column</li>
        <li>Field number must start with char 'f'</li>
        <li>Make sure that field numbe that you want to enter, is present in field definition</li>
        <li>We can remove the field that we dont want in request, by clicking on corresponding delete button</li>
        <li>Number of character in field value can not be more than specified FieldMaxLength properites value</li>
        <li>We can export the request data, to reuse in future and save time from re-entrying data by importing request data</li>
        <li>Once we send the request, time counter will be shown till response is received. Value of time counter is determined from http_recive_timout and tcp_recieve_timeout in configuration TAB</li>
        <li>If response is success, ie. response has been disassembled properly as iso8583, then it will be shown as field number and field value along with field description</li>
        <li>If response is not success, then proper error will be shown, we can use WEBCONSOLE TAB to find more details like at what stage, this error occured etc.</li>
      </ul>

  <section id="config">
    <div class="title">CONFIGURATION TAB</div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>
        We can use this tab to provide various configuration parameter that will decide how the request and response
        is processed. If we have multiple setup to test, we can export those specific configuration  to reuse latter.
        Below are the details of each configuration field. each configuration field has been categorized in 3 section.
